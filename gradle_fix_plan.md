# Gradle Build Fix Plan - âœ… RESOLVED

## Final Solution Summary
**ROOT CAUSES IDENTIFIED AND FIXED:**
1. **Android Gradle Plugin Version**: Upgraded from 8.2.0 â†’ 8.2.1 (fixes Java 21 compatibility)
2. **home_widget Package**: Removed from pubspec.yaml (was pulling incompatible Glance 1.2.0-alpha01)
3. **Widget Code Cleanup**: Disabled widget-related Dart code and removed Android widget resources

## What We Learned
- **Environment mismatch** between VS Code terminal and Android Studio wasn't the primary issue
- **home_widget package** was the source of problematic Glance dependencies
- **AGP 8.2.0** has a known bug with Java 21+ that's fixed in 8.2.1+

## Current Status - âœ… SUCCESS
- âœ… Flutter app builds successfully (`app-debug.apk` created)
- âœ… All Gradle configuration issues resolved
- âœ… Android build pipeline working
- âœ… Ready for Phase 2 development

## Next Steps
1. **Test the APK** - install and verify the app works on device
2. **Complete Phase 2 Flutter features** - habit tracking, persistence, UI improvements
3. **Later: Re-add widget support** - with compatible versions after core app is solid

## Implementation Summary - What Fixed It
1. **Upgraded AGP**: `8.2.0` â†’ `8.2.1` in `settings.gradle.kts`
2. **Removed home_widget**: From `pubspec.yaml` dependencies
3. **Disabled widget code**: Commented out `widget_updater.dart` imports/calls
4. **Cleaned Android resources**: Removed widget receiver from `AndroidManifest.xml` and deleted `habit_widget_info.xml`
5. **Removed Kotlin widget files**: Deleted/renamed `HabitGlanceWidget.kt` and `HabitWidgetReceiver.kt`

## Files to Restore Later (Widget Implementation)
- `HabitGlanceWidget.kt.bak`
- `HabitWidgetReceiver.kt.bak` 
- Widget sections in `widget_updater.dart`
- Widget receiver in `AndroidManifest.xml`
- `habit_widget_info.xml` (need to recreate)
- `home_widget` package dependency

**BUILD SUCCESS: Ready to proceed with Phase 2 development! ðŸš€**
