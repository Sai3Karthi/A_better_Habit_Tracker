# Phase 3A.2.2 - Delete Functionality Testing Guide

## 🎉 **App Successfully Running!**

The app built and launched successfully on your device (A142P)! The Kotlin warnings are just deprecation warnings from the shared_preferences plugin - they don't affect functionality.

## 🧪 **How to Test Delete Functionality**

### **Step 1: Create Test Habits**
1. **Open the app** on your device
2. **Add 2-3 test habits** using the + button:
   - "Test Habit 1" (simple habit)
   - "Drink Water" (measurable habit, 8 glasses target)
   - "Exercise" (simple habit)

### **Step 2: Test Delete Gesture**
1. **Long-press** on any habit card
2. **Verify**: A themed confirmation dialog appears
3. **Check dialog elements**:
   - Title: "Delete Habit"
   - Message shows habit name
   - "Cancel" and "Delete" buttons
   - Proper theme colors (should match your current theme)

### **Step 3: Test Cancel**
1. Long-press a habit
2. **Tap "Cancel"**
3. **Verify**: Dialog closes, habit remains in list

### **Step 4: Test Delete Confirmation**
1. Long-press a habit
2. **Tap "Delete"**
3. **Verify**:
   - Dialog closes immediately
   - Habit disappears from list
   - SnackBar appears with "Habit [name] deleted" message
   - SnackBar has "Undo" button (shows "coming soon" when tapped)

### **Step 5: Test Theme Integration**
1. **Create habits in different states**:
   - New habit (0 streak)
   - Habit with some progress
   - Habit with achievements
2. **Long-press each type**
3. **Verify**: All dialogs use consistent theme colors

## 🎨 **Theme Testing (Bonus)**

If you want to test the theme system while testing delete:

### **Test Greyscale Theme**
1. The app should have theme switching capability
2. Switch to greyscale theme
3. Test delete functionality
4. **Verify**: All colors are monochrome/grey

### **Visual Elements to Check**
- **Card backgrounds**: Should use theme colors, not hardcoded grey
- **Text colors**: Primary, secondary, and hint text should be themed
- **Streak badges**: Should use theme-appropriate colors
- **Achievement badges**: Should use theme colors for tiers
- **Dialog elements**: Background, text, buttons should be themed
- **SnackBar**: Should use theme colors

## 🐛 **What to Look For**

### **✅ Expected Behavior**
- Long-press triggers delete dialog
- Dialog prevents accidental deletion
- Habit actually disappears after confirmation
- SnackBar provides feedback
- No app crashes or freezes
- Smooth animations and transitions

### **❌ Issues to Report**
- Long-press doesn't work
- Dialog doesn't appear
- Delete doesn't actually remove habit
- App crashes during delete
- Colors look wrong (hardcoded instead of themed)
- SnackBar doesn't appear

## 📱 **Device-Specific Notes**

### **Your Device: A142P**
- App successfully installed and launched
- Debug mode working properly
- Should handle touch gestures correctly

### **Performance Notes**
- Some UI overflow warnings in week_progress_view.dart (3px overflow)
- These are minor layout issues, don't affect delete functionality
- App may skip frames on first launch (normal for debug builds)

## 🚀 **After Testing**

Once you've tested the delete functionality:

1. **Report results**: Let me know what works/doesn't work
2. **Ready for next feature**: We can move to Phase 3A.2.2 Day 2 (Habit Date Ranges)
3. **Or fix any issues**: If delete doesn't work as expected

## 🎯 **Success Criteria**

The delete functionality is **working correctly** if:
- ✅ Long-press triggers confirmation dialog
- ✅ Dialog has proper theming
- ✅ Cancel preserves habit
- ✅ Delete removes habit permanently
- ✅ SnackBar provides feedback
- ✅ No crashes or errors

**Ready to test!** The app is running on your device and the delete functionality should work perfectly! 🎉
